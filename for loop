            // The i = 0 means the output will start at the first letter of the string
            //The i < input.length() means the program would stop when it reachs the end of the string
            //and then the i++ means the program will move to the next letter each time
            System.out.println(input.charAt(i)); // the input.charAt(i) will pull out the character at the position i

//I figured this out from our previous lessons by knowing how to use the Scanner class to take input from the user 
//and then i used a for loop to go through the string from the users input. The loop starts at 0 because strings 
//in Java begin from zero. SO the program keeps going until it reaches the length of the string.
// The i++ makes the loop move to the next letter each time it like with the numbers but intead of a int its a string so it will not do math.
//The input.charAt(i) pulls out one letter from the string at a time so it can be printed on its own line.
